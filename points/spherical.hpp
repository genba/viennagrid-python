	 * What this makes is to set the pointer to point to the ViennaGrid point and thus solves the issue caused by
	 * the fact that the ViennaGrid point was being copied, thus not being able to get references to the points
	 * stored in the domain and thus not being able to modify them.
	 *
	 * This constructor is meant to be used by the wrapper code when the programmer tries to get a reference to
	 * a point stored in a domain (not when they want to define a point on their own!), and *does not* allocate
	 * memory in the heap, thus elliminating the need for the constructor to free that memory when this constructor
	 * has been used. At first, one would think that it should be distinguished in some way when the object has been
	 * instantiated using this constructor or any other constructor in order for the destructor to only free when
	 * another constructor has been called, not this one. However, we have shown that no freeing action is need at all.
